# My-Logo-Generator

## Description
I have created a logo generator that creates any logo type but answers simple questions, obtaining data to create the user's desired logo, color, text and shape.

## Installation
The first step was the creation of the repo. Then I had to create a package.json. Then I folders to organize the shape classes and another for the image. Lastly, I created an index file which contains the main code. 

## Usage
This logo generator is made for the purpose of creating a new logo in simple question steps. The terminal will ask simple questions regarding the text inside the logo, the shape, and the color for both. It automatically creates it and saves it in the example folder, for the user to come back and check it.
